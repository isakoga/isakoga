### Welcome to my profile :smiling_face:

I'm Isadora Koga, 23 years old.
I like to transform code into real programs.

My passion for development started when I was a curious child wanted to know how does the internet works!
For many years I focus my study on frontend stacks, but once I had to work with backend I found my real love on coding.

Nowadays I'm working as a Back-end Instructor on a Software Development course, but always open to new challenges and oportunities.
