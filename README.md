### Welcome to my profile ðŸ˜„

I'm Isadora Koga, 24 years old.
I like to transform code into real programs.

My passion for development started when I was a curious child wanted to know how does the internet works!
For many years I focus my study on frontend stacks, but once I had to work with backend I found my real love on coding.

Nowadays I'm working as a Frontend Software Engineering at Arcotech!
